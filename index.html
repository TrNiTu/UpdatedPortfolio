                        Finite Automata) and NFAs. (Nondeterministic Finite Automata). This class further guided me
                        through learning more about how to tackle computational complexity and undecidable problems.

                        Java and SQL while also tackling weekly labs. This allowed me to push the boundaries of real
                        world experience as well as allowing me to gain hands-on experience with both an Object Oriented
                        Programming language and a database query language. During each of the phases of this project I
                        was required to create, update, and revise a design document to explain the best practices I
                        used and how I tackled the corresponding phase. The languages used in this course were C, PHP

                        For an example, one of our projects was to read and write assembly in order to defuse a fake
                        bomb as well as using injections to "hack". The final project in this course was to use an
                        Altera motherboard and have the switches on it do different things when turned on and off, for
                        an example having a light turn on when the switch is on. The primary languages used in this
                        course is C and x86 Assembly.</p>

                        that were assigned. This course gave me a larger understanding on how to manage resources in

                        assignments were given, each in a different programming language. I then had to complete
                        different projects using four different languages. Because of the use of the various languages,
                        I gained a more firm grasp of understanding data types and control structures. The primary
                        programming languages used during this course were ANTLR, JavaScript (ES6), Haskell, and Prolog.

                        company I currently working for is DMSi). We follow a lot of the current practices in the
                        industry. We communicate with the sponsors every week to update them on our progress as well as
                        develop a project for them during over the course of an academic year. If you're interested in

                        software engineers work in the current industry. In this course, we developed many mini projects
                        in teams or pairs where we had to use communication and problem solving skills in order to
                        complete the assignment. Some of the expectations of this class was to follow best practices and
                        use good git control. A combination of mockup wireframes, scrum meetings, and software
                        developing using the industries best practices were all used over the duration of this course.
                        The primary programming language used in this course is Object-Oriented C. The main git control
                        used in this course was GitHub.</p>

                        were two semester-long projects that I had to tackle. One of which was a solo project where I
                        had to create a topic, write a formal proposal, and formally present my findings with an
                        attached research document. In the group project, we had to utilize teamwork and communication
                        to create multiple escape rooms for others to escape. This class honed both my technical
                        communication skills as well as communication within a team.</p>
